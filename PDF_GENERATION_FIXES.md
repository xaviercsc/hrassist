# PDF Generation Fixes - Interview Questions

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### üêõ **Issue 1: Double Numbering**
**Problem:** Questions were numbered twice in the PDF output:
```
1. 1. Can you explain your experience with Python frameworks...
2. 2. Describe your hands-on experience with Kubernetes...
```

**Root Cause:** The AI already returns numbered questions, but the PDF generation was adding another set of numbers.

**Solution:** Added regex pattern to remove existing numbering from AI-generated questions:
```python
clean_question = re.sub(r'^\d+\.\s*', '', question)
```

### üêõ **Issue 2: Text Truncation**
**Problem:** Long questions were getting cut off at the right margin and wrapping was not working properly.

**Root Cause:** Using basic `canvas.drawString()` which doesn't handle text wrapping.

**Solution:** Switched to ReportLab's `Platypus` layout engine with `Paragraph` objects that automatically handle text wrapping.

## ‚úÖ **Complete Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Enhanced PDF Generation Function**
```python
@app.get("/api/applications/{application_id}/questions/pdf")
def download_questions_pdf(application_id: int, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user), db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # New implementation with proper formatting
```

### 2. **Key Improvements Made**

#### **Text Processing:**
- ‚úÖ Remove double numbering with regex: `r'^\d+\.\s*'`
- ‚úÖ Clean up extra whitespace
- ‚úÖ Filter out empty questions

#### **PDF Layout:**
- ‚úÖ Proper margins (1 inch top/bottom)
- ‚úÖ Professional typography using ReportLab styles
- ‚úÖ Automatic text wrapping for long questions
- ‚úÖ Proper spacing between questions
- ‚úÖ Automatic page breaks when needed

#### **Document Structure:**
- ‚úÖ Clear title: "Interview Questions"
- ‚úÖ Job position clearly displayed
- ‚úÖ Candidate name prominently shown
- ‚úÖ Clean numbering (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- ‚úÖ Consistent formatting throughout

### 3. **Updated Dependencies**
```python
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet
from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Spacer
from reportlab.lib.units import inch
import re  # For text processing
```

## üìã **Expected Output Format**

### **Before (Problematic):**

## üß™ **Testing**

Created `test_pdf_generation.py` to verify the fixes:
- ‚úÖ Tests question processing logic
- ‚úÖ Tests complete PDF generation
- ‚úÖ Verifies text wrapping works
- ‚úÖ Confirms no double numbering
- ‚úÖ Validates proper formatting

## üöÄ **Benefits of the Fix**

1. **Professional Appearance:** Clean, properly formatted PDFs
2. **Complete Content:** No more text truncation
3. **Proper Numbering:** Single, clean numbering system
4. **Scalable:** Automatically handles any number of questions
5. **Responsive:** Adapts to different question lengths
6. **Maintainable:** Uses ReportLab's robust layout engine

## üìù **Files Modified**

1. **`main.py`** - Updated PDF generation function
2. **`test_pdf_generation.py`** - New test file for verification
3. **Enhanced imports** for better PDF handling

The PDF generation now produces professional, properly formatted interview question documents that HR teams can confidently use during the interview process!
